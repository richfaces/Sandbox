        We can have two objects with the same access key like in this case:
        <ul>
            <li><a accesskey="b" href="#b1">Barnie</a></li>
            <li><a accesskey="b" href="#b2">Bill</a></li>
            <li><a accesskey="b" href="#b3">Buck</a></li>
        </ul>
        Unfortunately stuff with the same accesskey must be in the same list, so this wont work in FF with ALT+SHIFT, but will work with CTRL+ALT:
        <a href="#richfaces" accesskey="r">RichFaces</a> compomponent development with
        <a href="#jrebel" accesskey="r">jRebel</a> is way fast.
    </ui:define>
